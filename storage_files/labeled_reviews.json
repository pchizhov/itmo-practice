But after paying attention to the reservation, I realized we had reservations at 10 PM and not the 8 PM I thought we had. Well, we are not going to start dinner at 10 PM, so I went to Trip Advisor and Jhenn's Supper Club popped up. My wife and I are not Vegan, but there are a number of foods we don't eat. And our son, who lives in London, is a vegetarian. So we are limited, especially when we are going to a supper club where there is a set menu. So Jhenn's place not only sounded interesting, we didn't have to worry about what was being served. But this was going to be a new experience. Going to a stranger's house, with more strangers held a bit of \"concern.\" What the heck. You only live once. And it was just 1 dinner on our trip. If it was uncomfortable, and strained to be with strangers, we could always leave and catch fast food. The evening started out a little \"weird\" as the directions gave the address and it said there would be a \"sign\" on the door. We took the tube and then walked about 10 minutes and came to what we thought was the address, but there was no \"sign.\" We were looking for a \"sign.\" There was no \"sign!\" So now we are where we thought we should be, but we are obviously lost! There was this little sticker on the door, and my wife said she was going to check it. Sure enough, THIS was the sign we should have been expecting. We knocked and Jhenn opened the door. We went in and met Jhenn and Ed. We sat down in the living room and it was a little \"strained.\" That lasted 3 minutes! The others at the dinner were wonderful, and no conversation for the rest of the evening felt uncomfortable. By the time we were halfway through dinner, it was like we were sitting with longtime friends. The meal was UNBELIEVABLE! There was not a dish during the evening that was not wonderful. Even some of the things Jhenn \"warned\" us about for texture, were fantastic. If there was 1 thing that could have been better, Jhenn and Ed only sat down with us at the end of the meal. They were wonderful to talk with and it would have been great if they were with us the entire evening, instead of just at the beginning and the end. Not only was this an fantastic experience during our trip, it was definitely one of the most fantastic evenings we have EVER experienced in all of our travels, EVER! We will be in London for 1.5 additional weeks, and unfortunately, we don't have another evening that we could spend with Jhenn and Ed. Our son said as we were walking to the bus to get home, that he would definitely be back, if not once, a number of times, before he moves from London.

It was a complete and utter (expensive) let down, bordering on an unpleasant experience. The experience may be different for those attending for dinner service (which would explain the good reviews), as it certainly feels like the manager sees brunch as a quick money maker, rather then something to put effort into. The service was shockingly bad. At the start, it was disengaged and incredibly slow. All the staff seemed distracted with completing the number of deliveroo orders which were stacking up on the counter - we felt very much like an afterthought. I ordered a Peroni, 15 minutes after we were seated at the table, which then arrived another 30 minutes later. When I received the bill, I was charged for 2 beers, for £1 extra than was stated on the menu (£5.50, rather than £4.50). The food came out over a very long time, from the first plate to the last plate there was a gap of 30 minutes (not counting the serving of chips which was sent another 15 minutes after that). There was no apology from the server, or the manager. The food was average and lukewarm, nothing to write home about. There were no good options for coeliac. You have to pay £1 for a small serving of mayonnaise. When the bill came, it was full of inaccuracies (e.g. being charged for two beers). This is when the experience turned unpleasant. Instead of apologising and looking to quickly amend - the server turned defensive and bordering on aggressive. It felt so unnecessary, and seeing as the menu is not the cheapest, you expect a certain level of service. It really soured the tone and created the atmosphere that we were just there to make them quick money. We declined to pay the 12.5% service added on to our bill, and even at that point, where we continued to explain where we felt let down and under valued, the manager and the servers were defensive, disrespectful and bordering on aggressive.
